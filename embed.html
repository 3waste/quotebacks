As it is, if I get put in charge of the State Department of Road Maintenance, and I do an excellent job, my department won't get any bigger. Instead, it'll likely get smaller as I succeed in saving costs, perversely costing me political leverage. On the flip side, if I do a terrible job, and costs balloon, there's no good option for the state other than trying to improve my organization. As a result, bad organizations don't die, and good organizations don't win. If an exceptional successful Department of Road Maintenance could take the contract for Delaware and New Jersey, and a bad one has to worry about getting replaced by Pennsylvania's, it's likely that road maintenance would get much more efficient.
