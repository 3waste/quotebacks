      <div class="portal-content">This was never, ever something I ever thought I’d be doing. When I first flew to New York, I wanted to be a writer and an editor, and I kind of did both for a bit, but I was definitely not getting what I needed out of those things in a creative or monetary way. It wasn’t very fulfilling. Honestly, what got me into this work was the people I met and the people I’m around — I met so many people out here who are just so passionate about their art, and I just wanted to be a part of that in some way, and I felt like I’ve always been interested in creating for people who feel kind of outside of something. I never really knew what that could look like until we started doing Discwoman, and then starting the agency, and I was like “Oh, I guess I’m quite good at this.” I’m not saying I’m perfect. It’s still something I want to get better at.
