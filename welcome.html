<body class="welcome">
	<p>hello! welcome to blogger peer review.</p>

	<p>we're <a href="http://tomcritchlow.com">Tom</a> and <a href="https://tobyshorin.com.com">Toby</a>. thanks for trying out our tool! we made this tool to generate <span style="border: 1px dotted gray; background-color:yellow"><em>quotebacks</em></span>. quotebacks are like quote-retweets for the web, but using simple web-native technology. here's what one looks like:</p>

	<div class="portal-container-519256">
	<div id="portal-parent-519256" class="portal-parent-519256">
	<div class="portal-content-519256">The web is still a very young medium, and it has been influenced more than anything else by print media design. There is so much more that can be done with text on a screen than is being done today. Citations, drawing, chat, speech-to-text. There are opportunities everywhere, and the bar is low! If we are serious about unlocking the value of knowledge we should consider how to improve every part of the knowledge production stack, and that includes reading. As Laurel Schwulst says: “Imaginative functionality is important, even if it’s only a trace of what was, as it’s still a sketch for a more ideal world.”
	</div>       
	</div>

	<div class="portal-head-519256">       
	<div class="portal-avatar-519256"><img class="mini-favicon-519256" src="https://s2.googleusercontent.com/s2/favicons?domain_url=https://subpixel.space/&sz=64"/></div>     
	<div class="portal-metadata-519256">
	<div class="portal-title-519256">
	<div class="portal-author-519256">Toby Shorin</div>
	<div class="title-wrapper-519256">Open Transclude for Networked Writing</div>
	</div> 
	</div>

	<div class="portal-backlink-519256"><a target="_blank" href="https://subpixel.space/entries/open-transclude/" class="portal-arrow-519256">Go to text <span class="right-arrow">&#8594;</span></a></div>
	</div>  
	</div>	

	<p>we've found quotebacks to be really useful for a couple things:</p>
	<ol>
		<li><strong>quoting other people at length when you write online </strong><a target="_blank"href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2020/04/13/after-peacetime/">(here's an example in a post by Tom).</a></li>
		<li><strong>quoting <em>yourself</em> in your own blog posts</strong>- sometimes you've written the perfect thing already. <a target="_blank" href="http://subpixel.space/entries/building-for-the-culture/#portal-parent-emotional-deficit">(here's an example in a post by Toby.)</a></li>
	</ol>
	<p>quotebacks can be used anywhere a normal block quote might go. they help give added context, structured metadata, and better linking back to the original author.</p>

	<p>try creating one yourself: select the paragraph below with a triple-click, then press <strong><span style="background-color: AliceBlue;">&#8984;+shift+s</span></strong></p>

	<p style="background-color: AliceBlue; border: 1px dotted Cyan; padding: 5px;">The web is still a very young medium, and it has been influenced more than anything else by print media design. There is so much more that can be done with text on a screen than is being done today. Citations, drawing, chat, speech-to-text. There are opportunities everywhere, and the bar is low! If we are serious about unlocking the value of knowledge we should consider how to improve every part of the knowledge production stack, and that includes reading. As Laurel Schwulst says: “Imaginative functionality is important, even if it’s only a trace of what was, as it’s still a sketch for a more ideal world.”</p>

	<p style="width:50%;">nice! see that popup there? you can change the title and author, if you want.</p>
	<p style="width:50%;">now all you need to do is <strong><span style="background-color: AliceBlue;">click "<> Embed"</span></strong> and you'll grab a nice block of HTML. Then just <strong><span style="background-color: AliceBlue;">paste</span></strong> it into your blog post, and you'll generate a nice-looking link that looks like this:</p>

	<p>every quote you save is also stored - locally, and not in the cloud. we built a small tool to browse and search for any quotes you've saved.</p>

	<a href="chrome-extension://onojfidcfnnjdfmhklhdgfjdcfnccdla/options.html#">you can find that here.</a>

	<p>so what next?</p>
	<p>one thing you can do right now is go to your own blog posts, and try generating a ______ for one of the blog posts to see how it feels. go get it!</p>
