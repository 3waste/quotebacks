 I also acknowledge the reader – my friend – which in turn opens up the potential to situate the reader’s own experiences as also being significant. But this is not just about seeing one’s personal experiences “represented.” In her letter, my friend also expressed the desire to share Rankine’s work with friends and colleagues, pointing to the potential for building up a collective dialogue around how racism feels through the body for those who experience it, experience it differently or don’t experience it at all. This act of turning a personal source of empowerment into collective agency is something I have learned is a legacy of feminist pedagogies for collective empowerment and transformational change.

The high-rise part has unexpected positive effect even if you don’t live on a high floor with a view. The reinforced concrete frame makes noise levels lower. Especially from above.Though core variables like square footage have gone down, everything else has been tech-improved

What the "unplug for self-care" crowd doesn't get is that you are part of a Giant Social Computer in the Cloud (GSCITC) computing the future. The level and latency at which you consume information and act on it determines your "job" in the social computer. Your shitposting and FOMO are functional.

<p>The error handling we used for the bot was heavily inspired by ELIZA: as soon as we don’t know what’s going on, we need to take charge of the conversation.</p>

<p>In addition to the parsing that happens <em>before</em> a sentence is sent to dialogflow, there’s also a layer that happens afterward. If no intent was detected (e.g. there was a Default Fallback Intent), then we hit this layer.</p>

<p>This layer tries to do a much more generic analysis of what’s happening using a Parts of Speech tagger to identify the <em>kind</em> of sentence that was said, and either deflect from it or change the conversation.</p>

<li id="02"><h3>Sprats:</h3> &nbsp; That's a 3-1/2 ounce can of Swedish 
  sprats (not smoked Baltic sprats). Many recipes not in Swedish call 
  for "Anchovies". This is wrong! Ansjovis in 
  Swedish means Sprats. Actual anchovies are called sardeller. 
  Swedish sprats are totally different from Baltic sprats. They are not 
  smoked and are packed in sugar, salt, vinegar and spices (particularly 
  cloves and cinnamon), and come about 20 fillets to a 3-1/2 ounce flat 
  can yielding 2 ounces drained. Abba brand are no longer sold by IKEA 
  and cost 2018 US $11 on-line (more than half for perishable shipping).
